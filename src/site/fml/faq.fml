     <question>Is there an easy way to generate the aggregate report ?</question>
     <answer>
       <p>
       Unfortunately Maven's internal support for report aggregation
  is rather poor so it does have a number of limitations.  Foremost the aggregate report is generated *before* the child
  reports so you must re-run the JavaNCSS report after the children have generated, like this:`
      </p>
      <p>
<code>
  mvn clean site:site (generate the site for every module recursively)
  mvn javancss:report (re-run the JavaNCSS report recursively so the aggregate report works)
</code>  
       </p>
