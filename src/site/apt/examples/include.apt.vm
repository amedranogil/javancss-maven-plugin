Include/Exclude Configuration
 
 You may need to exclude or include some file conditionally.
 The Maven 2 JavaNCSS is able to do this by using the standard <excludes> and <includes> tags.
 By default all classes of your source directory are included.
   
 Take a look at the following example to learn how to include and exclude conditionally:
 
-------------------
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>javancss-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        
        <configuration>
          <includes>
            <include>**/*foo.java</include>
          </includes>
          <excludes>
            <exclude>**/bar.java</exclude>
            <exclude>**/foobar.java</exclude>
          </excludes>
        </configuration>
      
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
